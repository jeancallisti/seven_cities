Do you want to hear about my trip to the Orient?

How have things been here at Barnett?
È‡Ô˘Á
Have you seen Marcus?

Water balloon incident?

Can you tell me anything about that trip Marcus went on?

What was that about Marcus again?

Goodbye.

In all honesty, no. I have a ton of marking to do.

Things have been going well here. Except for that "Water balloon incident"... Don't ask.

Marcus? He left last week on a trip to the Southwest, I believe.

Well, it all started a week ago when two students decided to... No, no, I'm not going through this again. It's in the past, Indy, leave it there.

Sorry, no.  Wait... That reminds me. I believe a telegram arrived this morning for you, check with your secretary.

Thanks for the information.

You were sent a telegraph, go to your secretary to find out more.

Goodbye, Doctor Jones.

I heard that a telegram came in for me?

Do you want to hear about my trip?

Irene do you have a spare key?

No, I haven't.

Oh, yes... It slipped my mind. A telegram from Marcus arrived for you this morning...

I put it in your file cabinet in your office...

Here, take this key for your office cabinet.

Thanks.

Not now, I'm very busy.

For your cabinet again Doctor Jones? Yes, right here.

Bye, Doctor Jones.

Maybe this will teach you to apply yourselves.

You shouldn't be surprised, you've been failing all year long.

Well, you did put that frog in Irene's desk...

Well, you did hang Professor Mulbray's shorts from the flagpole...

Well, you did egg Marcus Brody's car...

Well, you did throw a rock through the dean's window...

Really?  Maybe we'll win some games now.

Maybe when you learn to behave then they'll let you play again.

I was just doing my duty as a teacher here.

Yeah, well, maybe me and Bruno have more important things to worry about than people who find old junk in the dirt! Right, Bruno?

Haw, haw, haw!

And that's not all! You also ratted us out to the principal for being trouble makers!

Hey, we were trying to give her a little gift!

Well, that's not the worst of it, teach! Because of what you did, we have been suspended from the team!

Well, ok, maybe we did do that...

Hey! We were just eating lunch when the eggs... Uh... Slipped out of our hands!

That was an accident! The rock slipped out of my hand as I was... Uh... Cleaning it!

Well, you're going to be sorry for messing with us, teach! Right, Bruno?

What is it again that you expect me to do, young man?

I need to hear NOT USED

Don't you think that's a little disrespectful?

I'm counting to three...

I've had enough of your behaviour!

I need to hear everyone's opinion before I take my decision.

ZZzzzZZZZ...

I have a feeling that...

...I'm not getting out of this room any time soon...

ZZzzzzzzzzzz...

ZZzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZzzz!

*dribbles*

Professor!

Stop!

Ignore Biff!

We need your attention!

Yes, yes, forgive me, I got carried away.

*snort*

Charming.

Do you have a favorite topic?

I need to hear everyone's opinion.

Yes, I like Romans.

Yes, they're quite fascinating.

Please hurry, professor.

I don't know... I enjoy doing research about the Orient.

I understand, they have such a mystical spirituality!

Yes, but I prefer their means of visual expression.

Comic books have always been more attractive than sacred books I suppose.

Yes, I like everything related to crafting.

I've heard you're quite the manual guy. Keep it up!

What is it again that you expect me to do?

Tell me again what you expect from me?

How about each of you picks a subject that suits them?

I actually have the subject just right here...

Listen, all of you, I've chosen a subject.

NOT USED

Do you have a particular field of interest?

Professor, we've been asking you the same thing for the last three weeks!!!

The holidays are coming, and the final exams after that.

So, I suppose that's a relief for all of you?

Not at all, professor! We're still waiting on you.

Please pick a subject for our final essay with you!

Oh, haven't I already? I thought I had.

Not at all! We've been asking you at the end of every class.

It's been weeks, now. And you keep postponing.

Without the subject, we'll have way too much work at the end of the semester.

We can't wait any longer!

I understand.

We need you to give us a subject for our final essay.

That's not fair!

What about the grades?

We don't have time for that!

You made us wait for that?

Professor, it wouldn't be fair to let everyone pick their own subject.

Then how would we be sure that the evaluation is unbiased?

Yes, of course. The bias. I was going to say that.

You scared us!

At last!

I knew it!

Thanks, professor.

How about...

The subject will be...

It's not my role to tell what should be the essay's subject.

Still, tell me what's your favorite topic in Archeology.

I like everything that announces the Renaissance period.

Oh yes. The end of very old Empires... Tragic.

...Medieval Spain fiefdoms?

...Archaic Greece politics?

...Antic Cretan symbolism?

...Mayan economics?

I need to think more about it

What?

But!

No!

Why?

Professor, you already gave us that topic last semester!

Oh yes, that's absolutely true. Apologies.

Professor, Mr. McCumber gave that exact same subject to his students two weeks ago.

They would have an advantage over us!

My my, that's right. Apologies.

This subject is on next year's program.

Oh yes, my bad. Apologies.

We never studied that with you, professor.

Indeed, I did that with another class. Apologies.

wood carving

giant stone structures

metal foundries design

clay extraction

Oh wait, what was I saying?

trading

catling

artwork

religion

Constantinople

Padua

Rome

Goa

Attila's ruling

Scipio Africanus' command

Mehmet II's reign

Barbarossa's reign

"The many uses of...

...in the field of...

...in...

...at the time of...

Attila's ruling".

Scipio Africanus' command".

Mehmet II's reign".

Barbarossa's reign".

"The many uses of wood carving in the field of artwork...

...in Constantinople at the time of Mehmet II's reign."

That sounds like a very interesting subject, professor.

I hope you didn't pick something oriental just for me!

I like that it's about the Eastern Roman Empire.

And it's about sculpting artwork.

Thanks for considering choosing the very beginning of the renaissance!

So, you all like the topic?

Yes, and that artifact is a great motivation...

The first Ottomans were having close relations with Constantinople...

Indeed. Maybe this artifact is of Byzantine influence!

I'm sure the whole class will work heartily on that essay!

Then we're all happy.

Now, can you please all get out?

So, are you ready to start working on that essay, now?

To tell the truth...

What, don't tell me you're still not happy?!?

It's too abstract!

We need a visual support!

Show us an artifact!

We wouldn't know where to start!

You see, professor, other teachers usually show us an artifact

to make the subject more interesting...

...And I didn't.

Are you saying my classes are boring?

Not at all, professor. You know I find you amazing.

I mean, your classes.

That's a relief.

...But I can't force the class to be really interested in that subject.

Unless I show them a great artifact.

Yes.

I can't pull that.

I can't push that.

That just won't work.

I don't know what to do.

I see nothing special about it.

Why would I want to pick that up?

I shouldn't start talking to things.

That won't work.

I can't open that.

I can't close that.

I don't need that.

It's too heavy to pull it

It's too heavy to push it

Let it be.

I can't pick up something that big!

Violence is not a solution here.

I don't just push people around.

I'll keep that to myself.

I don't randomly touch people.

Yes, why don't I just carry everybody around on my back?

You mean, open that person with a knife or something?

That doesn't make sense.

I don't think that will work.

Nu-uh.

No.

Nope.

That's silly.

Why would I try that?

I'll have to think of something more useful.

No way.

I can't figure it out.

I'd rather keep that to myself.

I won't give that away.

Bad idea.

Let's keep that to myself.

I can't pull him, he's not a lever.

I don't think Mulbray needs to see my wallet.

How would you tell which hammer is genuine, and which one is fake?

Hmm... They look exactly the same. That's amazing.

It's that student.. You know? the head of copy club.

He's really brought copy techniques to a whole new level.

...But I'd say this is the genuine hammer.

genuine hammer

copy of hammer

Thanks a lot!

I don't think he'd like that.

Mulbray isn't a door.

Hello, Professor...

Welcome back, Doctor Jones... I trust your trip to the Orient went well?

Yes, I guess it did...

Well, that's good to hear.

It's Professor Mulbray.

I can't pick up Mulbray...

That wouldn't do anything.

Why would I want to do that?!

No, I have a feeling I'll need it.

I don't think she'd like that.

Not now, maybe later...

Good afternoon, Irene.

Good afternoon, and welcome back Doctor Jones.

It's Irene, my secretary.

There's no way I'd ever do that.

He's a jerk, but that doesn't mean I should be pushing them around.

I have no need to bribe them.

... But I'd pay him if he'd wash my car.

I doubt that would change anything.

That can't work.

Hello, Biff...

Hey teach, you have some nerve for flunking us!

Ah yes, that last test...

Yeah, well me and Bruno aren't happy about it!

Talking to them anymore would be a waste of time.

One of Barnett College's juvenile delinquents.

No, that wouldn't be good idea..

I don't think so.

He doesn't seem to be the talkative type.

Come on, Jones, you've asked enough questions now...

...You should be able to come up with something without guessing.

I won't get anywhere that way...

...I can't just make up topics.

ShowCompass: not implemented yet

What do you think of that interesting piece of history, young man?

...ZzzZZzzzz...

I should throw it at his face.

Sandy, I understand you'll be talking on behalf of your fellow students?

Yes, professor.

Don't you find that artifact interesting?

It looks nice, professor. What is it exactly?

It's a metal compass from the early Ottoman Empire.

Oh, professor, that sounds like a fascinating starting point!

I'm sure this artifact would stimulate us all!

But what subject do you want us to write about, based on it?

Sandy, that's very simple.

I suggest...

Well Sandy, I, erm....

I suppose you could write on...

Well, it's a...

It's definitely...

Give me a second, Sandy, I can't answer all the questions at the same time!

I'm growing old if I let students outsmart me...

Now, Wendy, you're a reasonable student. What's the matter?

Professor, you should ask Sandy, she's the class president.

Doesn't that artifact stimulate your curiosity?

Hmm...Interesting. Show it to Sandy, professor.

Well, well, Ron. What's all the fuss about?

Sandy, please explain Professor Jones what the issue is.

That artifact catches the eye, doesn't it?

It lsure does, professor. But show it to Sandy, please.

Young man, why don't you start from the beginning?

I think it's better if you ask Sandy, professor.

She's better at explaining.

I'm sure you could write a brilliant essay, based on that.

Professor, maybe Sandy could have a closer look?

Why does it always have to be about gigantic things?

Pity it's never about human-sized, individual creations.

Here we go again. Religion, religion, religion.

So much for visual expression.

And I have a feeling this class is a bit Europe-centered.

What does Attila have to do with any of this?

That doesn't even make sense historically!

The German Romans setting colonies in India? Well that's new...

Does every essay have to deal with Antiquity or the Middle Ages?

Professor, why do you pick the city of Rome?

It wasn't the center of the Empire at the time...

Now, now. Enough complaining. That subject is not perfect, alright.

I made a mistake. Let me fix that.

I'd rather not, I might spill the oil.

It's already properly closed.

It's an oil can I took from the janitor's closet.

Why would my cabinet key open this oil can?

...And risk having my papers ruined?

It's the key to my office cabinet.

...And have the key all slimy? No, thanks!

Let's take a look at that telegram.

There's no envelope. Nothing to open.

No way, that would ruin the telegram.

That's my wallet.

There's nothing of interest in it.

Why would I spill oil all over my papers?

Apparently it's some sophisticated metal compass.

It's from the the early Ottoman Empire, at the end of the middle ages.

It was used by muslim artists and decorators.

They were ornamenting everything with geometric shapes in that era.

That device helped designing them.

Yes, that's defnitely the artifact the tag is about.

It's a strange metal artifact. I can't date it, and I don't know what it's for.

Thanks to the tag, I know what this artifact is.

There's no point in disassembling it.

Hey! It's the description tag of that ancient metal device.

Irene probably left the tag in my drawer to make sure it wouldn't be lost.

It's one of those tags we use to classify our artifacts.

Here is what it says:

It's a ceremonial hammer... But I don't know if it's a copy.

It's a ceremonial hammer. That's the real one.

I'm not waving that around.

I looks really very much like the real one.

In discovering his past, man can discover his future...

OK, then... Read chapters 21 and 22 for next week. You are dismissed.

Wait!

The essay!

We need to know!

I'm sorry, what? Not all at the same time, please!

The final essay!

The holidays are coming!

The subject!

You promised!

Oh, it's about that final essay again, is it?

At last.

It's good to be back here at Barnett College. My last trip to the Orient wasn't very restful.

I wonder where Marcus is? I haven't seen him since I've gotten back... I better find out where he is.

I should find Marcus.

I should probably put in a word for a new one.

I have better things to do than rehearsing my course.

This isn't some secret passage leading to a crazed genius who creates evil mutant tentacles.

I read that in 'Detective Illustrated' at the barber's.

I'm done for today.

It's flat, and it has drawers. It's a desk.

I don't think there is anything else in it.

I don't think there is anything in that drawer that can help.

Wait! There is a small tag. I don't recall putting it in here.

I'll take it.

I have more urgent matters to attend to, right now.

I don't want to pull that.

That wouldn't work.

I have nothing to add to the billboard.

It can't be opened.

It can't be closed.

It's a billboard.

FOR SALE: 1938 Packard. Call Frank.

I have a feeling that won't work.

Let's see if there is anything interesting back there.

Nope. What did I expect to find in an empty classroom?

Where are you going?

Are you even listening to us?

We need an answer!

Yes, yes, of course I'm listening. I'm not leaving before we find a solution together.

Someone left that artifact on my desk before the class.

Probably Irene, my secretary.

I suppose a colleague of mine thought it would be of interest for me.

FOR SALE: A math hand book. Will sell for $50,[ or trade for new slide rule.

I think they are fine where they are.

That's not really possible.

I don't need to use these.

I have no need to take the pictures. Besides, they are fine where they are.

I don't think that will do anything.

That's not a good idea.

I think the case is fine where it is.

I don't have any artifacts on me.

I'm not going to steal them!

It's already closed!

No, they belong in there.

It's a display case with some minor pieces that I collected in my travels.

The case is fine, I don't need to do anything with it.

No, I'd get all wet.

I don't think that'll do anything.

That wouldn't do anything productive.

This can't be opened.

This can't be closed.

Well, I guess I could go for a small drink...

Ah, refreshing.

It's a drinking fountain.

That's not going to happen.

I don't want to get my money all wet.

I don't want to ruin the telegram!

The fountain doesn't need to be tinkered with.

I could move the tape, but I don't want to mess up the paint job or my shoes...

It's taped off because it has just been painted.

That wouldn't help.

I don't think that's a good idea.

I really don't think that will do anything.

It's the janitor's broom.

Where do you think we are? This could work on Mars, but not here!

That's not possible.

That's not really going to work.

I can't really get there, the paint on the stairway is drying.

The hallway is not a person.

That won't do anything useful.

It's the door to my classroom

It's the door to Professor Mulbray's classroom

There's a class in session in there. I don't want to go in and disturb it.

It's the door to Iren's office

This is the janitor's closet

This is the exit to the Campus.

I should find out where Marcus left before I decide to go somewhere.

I better not... I could spill the oil and cause a mess.

No, I don't think that'll work.

It looks to be an oil can, although knowing the janitor it could be anything.

I don't think anybody will mind if I take this.

I can't talk to that!

I don't think I can use anything with that.

Mulbray's chalkboard sure is cluttered.

I don't think the chalkboard will work with that.

I have better things to do than talk to inanimate objects.

I'm not in the mood.

It's attached firmly to the wall.

That wouldn't solve anything.

Why would I want to carry around a chalkboard?

As much fun as it would be to push the desk and give myself a back spasm, I think I'll pass.

I can't give to that.

I don't think Mulbray would like me going through his drawers.

It's a desk.

I'd probably break them if I did that.

I don't think that will do anything useful.

That's not really necessary.

Some photos belonging to Irene, or so I would assume.

I don't think that works.

I don't need Irene's photographs.

I really don't want to do that.

I think they are fine in their present condition.

No, Irene would get mad.

There's no point to that.

I have no need to do that.

It's Irene's desk.

I don't want to bother.

No, I don't think that would do anything.

I don't think Irene would like that.

I don't really want to.

No, that would get Irene mad.

It's today's date: Friday, April 12, 1940. I wish it was the weekend already...

I don't need to take Irene's calendar.

That will never do anything useful.

It's working fine, I don't want to mess with it.

That's not needed.

No, I don't want to mess with it.

There's no need to do that.

This was a gift from the school to Irene.

Seems a bit heavy to carry around...

I have a feeling that will yield no results.

I don't think Irene wants me doing that.

That wouldn't be useful.

It's just Irene's file cabinet.

There's nothing I need from the file cabinet.

I don't want that.

That doesn't really work.

No, I don't think that's a good idea.

I can't really do that.

Pointless... Marcus is not at home.

I hope the mobile phone will be invented soon.

It's my telephone.

II don't want to lug that around.

That won't help my current situation.

I don't need to do that.

It's already a mess, I don't want to make it worse.

No, I don't want to mark these terrible papers now.

My students' work. What a mess.

I have no need for them!

No, that's not going to happen.

The window is already shut.

It looks like a nice day outside.

I don't need to open the window right now.

That wouldn't do anything useful.

That's a bad idea, last time I did that I threw out my back.

That won't do anything.

The drawer is already closed.

No, I don't want to move it.

It's my desk.

There's nothing in the drawer, why bother?

That won't accomplish anything.

I think it's fine where it is.

It's a rare Ancient Roman statue of an Emperor's two pets: We believe that one of them was called Maximus.

It's too heavy for me to do that.

No, that won't solve anything.

Looks pretty heavy, I better not.

I don't think that's possible.

I doubt that will do anything.

Poor Marcus... He bought this from a street vendor in Cairo. He insists that it is actually the nose from the Sphinx...

Now why did I let Marcus talk me into keeping this in here?

I don't think that will work..

These things won't go together.

I think that Chuck is fine where he is.

This used to be at my father's house, but he gave it to me as a gift last year.

Hi Chuck!

I don't think that would work.

Just some oddities I've collected in my travels...

I don't need anything from there.

No, there is nothing from the shelf I need.

I don't want to do that.

It's locked. I need my office key to open it.

It's all gripped.

It's not gripped anymore...

...But it would need a proper shock to be released.

This mode is not in use.

My old file cabinet... So old you could probably call it a relic!

Here's a telegram from Marcus!

I already got the telegram. There's nothing else of interest in the cabinet.

No, I don't want to pick the cabinet up.

It's not going to happen.

Not implemented : Indy take out his hammer

There! The oil has eased the drawer...

But it's still in the wrong position. What it needs now is a good bang.

It doesn't need any more oil. What it needs is a good bang.

Dang. The cabinet is stuck. I knew I should have had someone fix it before.

I guess some lubricant would help.

Now, now. It opens with a key.

A shock would help, but if I don't lubricate it first, I'll just break it.

The lock would be completely stuck.

I'm not using those hammers until I'm sure which one is the fake one.

And now, it's time to give it a good shock.

Wait.

Oh, dear. Which one is the real hammer again?

They look exactly the same!

The copy club seems to have made enormous progress. I'm in big trouble.

a hammer

another hammer

OK, that's the fake hammer for sure.

*BANG!*

Everything alright there, professor?

Yes, Irene, thank you!

I'm not using an authentic ceremonial hammer[as a vulgar tool!

I don't need to add that to the file cabinet.

It's a genuine ceremonial hammer.

It's not hammer time.

I'll take it

It's a copy of a ceremonial hammer.

I guess I better head over to Arizona! I wonder what Marcus discovered there?

I think that this will teach old Doctor Jones a lesson not to mess with us!

He won't be going anywhere for awhile with a slashed tire, will he, Bruno?

Haw haw haw!

Just, great... It looks like someone slashed my tire!

I can't pull my car!

I have no need to push my car.

I don't think I can give to my car.

I better close the trunk first...

Arizona, here I come!

I can't leave now, the tire is flat!

It's my car.

No, that won't do anything.

Maybe if I use this with the flat tire...

Now that's what I call some good work.

And I'm not even dirty.

There's no point to that...

The trunk works fine, I don't need to do anything with it.

It's the trunk of my car.

I can't close that!

That's not going to improve anything.

No, that can't work.

I'm not walking to the airport, it's tens of miles away!

... This stone artifact was discovered in my class dig.

Several other Aborigine artifacts were discovered in the dig.

Now the dig wasn't a major dig and the artifacts we discovered were not major finds...

But each piece of history that archeology can uncover is important in the large scale of things...

Every clue to man's past is a vital piece of knowledge.

Hey yo, Mr. White!

Imma make some badass pixel-art.

Let's start cooking, BITCH.

This screen is meant for testing fonts in several languages.

Please note that it only tests TTF fonts (that support UTF-8 characters).

(In other words: it only tests native multilingual fonts)

The bits of text that you will see were entered 'as-is' in AGS' script editor.

AGS' script editor does support UTF-8 encoding. The question is : does this font too?

Current font is: 'not implemented yet'
